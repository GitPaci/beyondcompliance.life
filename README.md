# BeyondCompliance.life

**BeyondCompliance.life** is a scenario-based training platform for pharmaceutical GMP data integrity.

It helps teams practice **defensible decisions under pressure** rather than only learning rules in static training.

## What this project is

A mission-style simulator where operators and QA professionals review evidence, respond to pressure events, and make ALCOA+ aligned decisions in realistic workflows.

## Why it matters

Traditional training explains policy. It often does not prepare people for:

- time pressure,
- production urgency,
- social influence, and
- escalation uncertainty.

This simulator is designed to build:

- better integrity habits,
- stronger inspection readiness,
- clearer decision accountability, and
- a culture of patient-first evidence protection.

## Core experience (MVP)

- **Mission scenario (10–12 min):** Users investigate a high-stakes batch release case.
- **Pressure layer:** Timed emails, IMs, and leadership prompts simulate real operational stress.
- **Integrity challenges:** Users must respond to GDP corrections, missing records, and timeline mismatches.
- **Outcome scorecard:** Results focus on patient risk and evidence defensibility, not “game points.”
- **Leadership preview:** QA leaders see behavioral impact and rollout value.

## Project documents

- [Master Plan](./masterplan.md) — product strategy, audience, MVP feature set, and success model.
- [Implementation Plan](./implementation-plan.md) — phased delivery and execution details.
- [App Flow, Pages, and Roles](./app-flow-pages-and-roles.md) — IA, user journeys, and role access model.
- [Design Guidelines](./design-guidelines.md) — tone, UX principles, visual system, and interaction guidance.

## Product principles

1. **Patient protection over speed pressure**
2. **Evidence defensibility over checkbox completion**
3. **Clarity over complexity**
4. **Behavior change over passive knowledge transfer**

## Suggested next steps

- Finalize a single vertical scenario scope (Manufacturing *or* QC).
- Lock decision tree and pressure timeline.
- Build core mission flow with analytics-first instrumentation.
- Pilot with QA leadership using measurable behavior outputs.
