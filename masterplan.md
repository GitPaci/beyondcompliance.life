# Master Plan

## 30-Second Elevator Pitch

**Beyond Compliance: The Data Integrity Mission Simulator** is a web-based GMP decision simulation where teams practice protecting patients and data integrity under realistic pressure.

It is designed to improve:

- inspection readiness,
- decision quality,
- escalation confidence, and
- integrity culture maturity.

---

## Problem and Mission

### The problem

Data integrity failures are usually not caused by ignorance. They are often caused by pressure:

- time constraints,
- customer escalation,
- production urgency,
- interpersonal influence.

Traditional training teaches ALCOA+ concepts, but rarely simulates stressful decision contexts.

### The mission

Build a digital simulator that trains defensible GMP decision-making under pressure by reinforcing:

- evidence protection,
- escalation discipline,
- GDP-correct documentation behavior,
- patient-first outcomes.

> Core belief: **Data integrity is patient protection.**

---

## Target Audience

### Primary buyer: QA leaders

They need:

- reduced inspection risk,
- stronger audit defensibility,
- measurable behavior impact,
- scalable training evidence.

### Primary users: operators and frontline contributors

They value:

- realism,
- practical relevance,
- professional trust,
- clear responsibility.

Desired user outcome: *“I can defend this decision during inspection.”*

## MVP Scope (Teaser Version)

### 1) Interactive mission scenario (10–12 minutes)

Users review a release-critical batch case and make sequential decisions.

### 2) Real-time pressure events

Timed interruptions introduce realistic stress (email, IM, manager calls) requiring explicit user responses.

### 3) Evidence protection challenges

Users handle issues such as:

- timeline mismatches,
- unqualified sign-offs,
- GDP correction choices,
- missing raw data.

### 4) Integrity scorecard

Final outcomes are framed as inspection readiness signals:

- patient risk exposure,
- evidence defensibility,
- GMP alignment,
- decision narrative quality.

### 5) QA leader preview mode

A decision-maker view showing:

- competencies trained,
- behavioral metrics captured,
- scalability and rollout potential.

---

## Technology Direction

- **Frontend:** React / Next.js
- **Backend:** Lightweight Node or serverless functions
- **Hosting:** Vercel or equivalent
- **Analytics:** Session and behavior instrumentation

Key tracked behaviors:

- escalation timing,
- GDP correction quality,
- response under pressure,
- risk-taking tendencies.

---

## Build Philosophy

- Build one excellent 10-minute scenario first.
- Prioritize clarity over feature volume.
- Measure behavior from day one.
- Make leadership value immediately visible.

**Target:** A funding-ready MVP in ~4–6 weeks.
