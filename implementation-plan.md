Build Philosophy

Build one powerful 10-minute scenario

Make it feel finished

Measure behavior

Impress QA leaders with clarity, not complexity

Goal:
Ship a funding-worthy MVP in 4–6 weeks.

Step-by-Step Build Sequence (Mindless Micro-Tasks)
Phase 0 — Alignment (Week 1)

Step 1 — Lock Scenario Scope

Choose: Manufacturing OR QC (not both)

Select 3 integrity signals only

Define final disposition logic

Deliverable:

One-page scenario outline

Step 2 — Define Decision Tree
For each signal:

What user sees

What options appear

What happens next

How score changes

No UI yet.
Just logic clarity.

Step 3 — Define Pressure Timeline

Example:

Minute 2 → Customer escalation email
Minute 5 → Internal IM pressure
Minute 7 → Plant manager call

Define:

Message copy

Emotional tone

Required user response

Keep each pressure event:

≤ 30 seconds to process

Clear decision required

Phase 1 — Experience Design (Week 2)

Step 4 — UX Flow Map

Map 6 screens max:

Mission Briefing

Record Review Screen

Pressure Event Overlay

Decision Confirmation Screen

Final Review Panel

Integrity Scorecard

Nothing more.

Step 5 — Wireframe (Low Fidelity)

Dark mission-control layout

Left panel: Documents

Right panel: Actions

Top bar: Mission timer

Subtle Integrity Meter

No decoration yet.
Just clarity.

Step 6 — Write All Microcopy

Tone:

Calm

Professional

Empowering

Examples:

Instead of:
“Wrong answer.”

Use:
“Evidence chain weakened. Reassess original source.”

Instead of:
“Good job!”

Use:
“Decision defensible. Evidence protected.”

Phase 2 — Build (Weeks 3–4)

Step 7 — Frontend Structure

Build components:

MissionHeader

DocumentViewer

PressureOverlay

ActionPanel

IntegrityMeter

ScorecardPanel

Keep them modular.

Step 8 — Decision Logic Engine

Store:

Signal detected (yes/no)

Escalation timing

GDP correction correctness

Raw data protection choice

Output:

Patient Risk Index

Evidence Defensibility Level

Inspection Readiness Score

Step 9 — Pressure Engine

Timed triggers:

Appear as modal overlays

Slight blur background

IM messages stack subtly

User must:

Acknowledge

Choose response

No passive scrolling.

Phase 3 — QA Leader Funding Layer (Week 5)

This is critical.

Step 10 — Build “Leadership View” Page

Separate route:
/leadership-preview

Includes:

What competencies are trained

Behavioral metrics captured

Example team dashboard

Rollout model (site-wide deployment vision)

This page sells funding.

Step 11 — Analytics Layer

Track:

Average escalation time

% users who ignore pressure

% who correct per GDP

% who escalate appropriately

These are your funding slides.

Phase 4 — Polish & Test (Week 6)

Step 12 — 3-User Guerrilla Test

Participants:

1 Operator

1 QA

1 Neutral observer

Ask:

Where did you hesitate?

What felt confusing?

What felt powerful?

Fix top 3 friction points only.

Step 13 — Emotional Audit

Check:

Does this feel serious, not playful?

Does it build pride?

Does it avoid shame?

Does it reinforce “patient protection”?

Remove anything gimmicky.

Timeline Overview

Week 1 → Scenario logic locked
Week 2 → UX + copy complete
Week 3–4 → Build
Week 5 → Leadership view + analytics
Week 6 → Test + polish

Total: 4–6 weeks

Team Roles
Product Lead (You)

Own narrative

Own funding positioning

Guard emotional tone

UX Designer

Mission-control aesthetic

Interaction clarity

Microcopy refinement

Frontend Developer

React build

State management

Animation timing

Backend/Logic Dev

Decision scoring

Data capture

Metrics output

QA Advisor (SME)

Validate GMP realism

Ensure integrity logic is defensible

Review pressure scenarios

Recommended Rituals
Weekly “Integrity Review”

Ask:

Would this survive inspection?

Is the compliant path clear?

Are we teaching instinct or trivia?

Bi-Weekly 30-Minute Usability Test

3 users.
No explanation.
Observe silently.

Log:

3 confusions

3 emotional reactions

Fix highest-impact issue first.

Optional Integrations (Post-Funding)

LMS completion tracking

SSO (Okta / Azure AD)

Site benchmarking dashboard

Audit evidence export

Role-based branching (Operator vs QA reviewer)

Stretch Goals (If Time Allows)

Adjustable pressure intensity

Multi-player team mode

AI-driven dynamic IM messages

Site-specific scenario customization

Success Criteria (For Funding Conversation)

QA leaders should say:

“This changes behavior.”

“This prepares teams for inspection reality.”

“This scales.”

“This measures what matters.”

If they say:
“That’s a fun game.”

We failed positioning.
