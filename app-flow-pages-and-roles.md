About the Integrity Simulator

No more than five top-level pages.
Clarity over complexity.

Purpose of Each Page
1. Home

Purpose:
Position the Integrity Simulator as a strategic capability, not a game.

Includes:

Headline:

Train Data Integrity Under Real GMP Pressure.

Short 60-second explainer

“Start Mission” CTA

“Leadership View” CTA

3 outcome pillars:

Protect Patients

Protect Evidence

Strengthen Inspection Readiness

Audience split made obvious:

“I’m an Operator”

“I’m a QA Leader”

Built-in virality without gamification.

Flow Logic Overview

Mission Flow:

Briefing → Record Review → Pressure Event → Decision → Next Signal → Final Decision → Scorecard

Pressure Events:

Customer escalation email

Internal IM messages (Sales / Supply)

Plant manager call overlay

Each event:

Requires acknowledgement

Requires explicit choice

Impacts Integrity Meter

Integrity Meter Logic (Visible System)

Meter states:

Green: Evidence protected

Amber: Pressure rising

Red: Evidence chain compromised

Meter should:

Change gradually

Never jump dramatically

Reflect cumulative behavior

Users must feel cause-and-effect.

Page-Level Emotional Consistency

Home → Strategic and serious
Mission → Focused and intense
Scorecard → Reflective and professional
Leadership Preview → Executive and measurable
About → Credible and principled

Never playful.
Never gimmicky.
Never “escape room” themed.

Final Alignment Check

This system:

Positions simulation as risk mitigation

Makes operators feel trusted

Makes QA leaders see ROI

Avoids trivializing GMP

Scales beyond MVP
